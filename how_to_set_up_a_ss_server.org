How to set up a ss server?
just follow my step :
* buy a vps, deploy a server
  1. vps : vultr, linode...
  2. the OS of the server : ubuntu is recommended
  3. update packages(this is not necessary):
     #+BEGIN_SRC
# update source list
sudo apt-get update

# update packages
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
     #+END_SRC
* install git
  1. git to be use to down the ss-bash code
  2. if you have other way to do this, then git is not necessary
  3. in my case, the ubuntu16.04 have installed git
  4. if there is not, you may install it like this :
     #+BEGIN_SRC 
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
     #+END_SRC
* install python-pip
  #+BEGIN_SRC 
  apt-get install python-pip
  #+END_SRC
* install shadowsocks
  1. do like this
     #+BEGIN_SRC 
     pip install git+https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks.git@master
     #+END_SRC
  2. you may see the error like this
     #+BEGIN_SRC 
Command "python setup.py egg_info" failed with error code 1 in /tmp/pip-qza8si-build/
You are using pip version 8.1.1, however version 9.0.1 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
     #+END_SRC
  3. follow the error message
     #+BEGIN_SRC 
     pip install --upgrade pip
     #+END_SRC
  4. now you may get this
     #+BEGIN_SRC 
Could not import setuptools which is required to install from a source distribution.
Please install setuptools.
     #+END_SRC
  5. do this to install setuptools
     #+BEGIN_SRC 
     pip install -U pip setuptools
     #+END_SRC
  6. then redo the step one in this step
  7. now you get it!!!
* install ss-bash
  1. 可以用来配置ss，添加用户，修改密码，监控流量...
  2. github: https://github.com/hellofwy/ss-bash
  3. this is a project in github, all you need to do is to git it down.
  4. the usage page is here
     https://github.com/hellofwy/ss-bash/blob/master/sshelp
  5. the first time you use it, may encounter situation like this : bc commond not found
     if this happened :
     #+BEGIN_SRC 
      sudo apt-get install bc
     #+END_SRC
* start service when the server start

* open TCP BBR
  BBR 目的是要尽量跑满带宽, 并且尽量不要有排队的情况
